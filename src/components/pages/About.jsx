                <p>Lord Krishna was born in Mathura, India, over 5,000 years ago, in a prison cell to Devaki and Vasudeva. 
                    The prophecy stated that Devaki's eighth child would kill her brother, the evil King Kamsa, so he had imprisoned them. On the day of his birth, the jailer was overcome by sleep, and Vasudeva was able to escape with the newborn baby by crossing the river Yamuna to Gokul where Nanda and Yashoda lived, and exchange Krishna with their newborn girl. Later, Kamsa found out that his sister's son was still alive and tried to kill him by sending demons to assassinate him. However, Lord Krishna defeated them all, and this is how his childhood was spent, playing and enjoying with his friends and family in Vrindavan.</p>
